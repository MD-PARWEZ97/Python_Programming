Q.4 write a code that describe local and global variable with
same name
x = 10 # This is a global variable
 def my_function(): # Local variable with the same name as the global variable
 x = 20 # This is a local variable, it overrides the global 'x' inside this function
 print("Inside the function:")
 print("Local variable x:", x) # Refers to the local 'x'
 my_function() # Calling the function
 print("\nOutside the function:") # Outside the function, the global variable 'x' is still accessible
 print("Global variable x:", x) # Refers to the global 'x'
